                            <p>
                                The developmental theories give the general
                                sociological and psychological stages that children
                                go through in their development processes. For
                                instance, Piaget has the cognitive stage theory, the
                                theory of which consists of a sensorimotor,
                                preoperational, concrete, operational and the formal
                                operational stage (Huitt, et al., 2003). The second
                                developmental theory of Erikson’s psychosocial
                                development theory established an emotional growth
                                approach based on eight developmental stages whereby
                                children require trust, autonomy and the ability to
                                be initiative. These points of views give us ideas
                                of how teachers can make curriculum well fitted for
                                children’s growth and developments in their
                                different aspects, as well as providing children
                                with challenging and rich thinking, problem solving,
                                and introspection activities.

                                Originally, socio-behaviourist theories consider
                                learning occurring from interactions with several
                                environmental factors and particularly stimuli
                                specific rewards and penalties. Understanding and
                                applying the principles of Operant conditioning To
                                ensure positive behaviours by the students, B.F
                                Skinner’s theory of positive and negative
                                reinforcements is used. The theory advanced by
                                Albert Bandura build on this by stating that
                                children learn through observing others and
                                mimicking them and the notion of modeling behavior
                                (Bandura, 1986).

                            <p>
                                Critical theories demand educators to respond to
                                emergent oppressions and hegemonic discourses in
                                education, inspired by critical theory. They engage
                                teachers in the practice of protesting against
                                social inequalities including discrimination,
                                prejudice and marginalization within classroom
                                (Freire, 2020). Critical theories as they are
                                applied in early childhood education therefore
                                entail having a curriculum, which is bias free and
                                encompasses issues to do with diversity, social
                                justice, and anti bias education to be able to
                                promote fairness, empathy and the ability of
                                children to question certain issues within society.

                                The postmodern and poststructuralist’ argument and

                                differences undermine the absolutes making the
                                educator to welcome openness and relativity in
                                learners (Dahlberg & Moss, 2004). These paradigms
                                empower educators to challenge fixed ways of
                                thinking and being and allow teachers to listen to
                                children and the child’s voice which makes children
                                creative, self expression and critical thinking.

                        In Bronfenbrenner’s theory, it looks at
                        different environments beginning with the
                        family, peers, culture to name but a few that
                        shape the child.

                                            certain behaviors(Rafi et al.,
                                            2020). For example, offering the
                                            children incentives to be polite
                                            and share promotes the children
                                            ' s engagement in prosocial
                                            behaviors. Repeating a word of
                                            encouragement to students for
                                            good behavior allows them to
                                            affirm the desired order in
                                            class.

                                            To accommodate the needs of
                                            diverse learners the teacher
                                            should incorporate cultural
                                            responsiveness. This involved
                                            teaching children about the
                                            different cultures through
                                            narrations, singing, and
                                            painting so that the children
                                            relate with the cultures learned
                                            while on the same note learning
                                            tolerance (Ilari et al., 2013).

                                            approach, teachers can support
                                            using general questions and
                                            material during the learning.
                                            This enhances the discovery of
                                            new ideas and the ability to
                                            come up with new ideas fostered
                                            in their playing through various
